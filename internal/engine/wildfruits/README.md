**Insights from Statistics:**

- The high RTP (varies usually between 95% and 105%) and relatively moderate volatility indicate a game that returns a large portion of bets to players while still providing moderate fluctuating win and loss dynamics.
- The bonus games are represented usually with a rate between 1.8% to 2%.
- Despite the high number of total spins, the net profit/loss demonstrates the tight balance of the game mechanics designed to mimic real-world casino slot machines. This also gives insights into the amount of risk the player has to take.

These statistics help understand the expectations and behavior of the current game. Also you can use it to adjust features, payouts and frequencies.
