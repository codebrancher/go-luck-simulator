# Play or RunSimulation

#### Key Parameters

You can modify them in the `main.go` and customize the simulations and playing experience.

| Parameters   | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| startingCash | Determines the initial amount of cash for gameplay or simulation. Increase for finer granularity in simulations. |
| visualDelay  | Controls the refresh rate of slot symbols. Set to 0 (no delay) for rapid simulation results.                     |
| autoDelay    | Sets the delay between automatic spins. Set to 0 for continuous spin execution in simulations.                   |
| runSim       | Toggles between interactive play (false) and simulation mode (true).                                             |
